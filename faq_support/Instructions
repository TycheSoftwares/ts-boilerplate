Add FAQ's submenu or tab in the plugin. 

To add this feature to the plugin, you can follow the below steps:

1. Copy the ts-faq-support.php file into your plugin folder. And faq-page folder into templates folder.

2. Include the ts-faq-support.php file once when on the admin page. This can be done with is_admin() function. 

3. Change the value of the $plugin_name, $plugin_folder, $plugin_url, $template_base variables of the ts_pro_notices class with the values of your plugin.

4. Replace the 'orddd_add_submenu' hook with the custom hook of your plugin. This needs to be done if you want to add a submenu in the main menu of your plugin. But if you want to add a tab, you need to comment this hook. 

5. Replace the 'orddd_add_new_settings_tab' hook with the custom hook of your plugin. This will add a new tab along with other tabs in the settings menu. 

6. Replace the 'orddd_add_tab_content' hook with the custom hook of your plugin. This will add the content to the tab.

5. Change the FAQ in the faq-page.php template files.
