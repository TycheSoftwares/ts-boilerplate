2. Include the file class-ts-deactivation.php once when on the admin page. This can be done with is_admin() function. 

3. Change the value of the $plugin_name variable of the TS_deactivate class with the name of your plugin.

4. Change the plugin folder name in the $this->plugins_url variable in default constructor of TS_deactivate class.

5. Modify the $ts_plugin_specific_questions variable with the plugin specific questions.

6. Accordingly, change the input types of the questions in the deactivate_options function.
