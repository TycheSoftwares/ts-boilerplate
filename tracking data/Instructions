Add a notice to ask customers to collect non-sensitive data for the plugin and provide them with 20% coupon code if they allow us to collect data. 

To add this feature to the plugin, you can follow the below steps:

1. Copy the ts-tracking.php file and class-ts-tracker.php file into your plugin folder. 

2. Include the file ts-tracking.php once when on the admin page. This can be done with is_admin() function. 

3. Change the value of the $plugin_name, $plugin_prefix, $blog_post_link and $plugin_context variables of the TS_tracking class with the values of your plugin.

4. Change the plugin folder name in the $this->plugins_url variable in default constructor of TS_tracking class.

5. Once done. Change the $plugin_prefix, and $plugin_name variables in TS_Tracker class of class-ts-tracker.php file. 

6. Change the plugin data in the ts_get_data_for_opt_out function of TS_Tracker class. This is the data which we need to collect when the user opts out from the notice. 

7. Change the plugin data to accept in the ts_add_plugin_tracking_data function of TS_Tracker class. 

IMP: ts_meta_data_table_name - this should contain the table name which will store the plugin specific data. This should not be skipped.
