Add some notices of Pro plugins in the lite plugins. 

To add this feature to the plugin, you can follow the below steps:

1. Copy the ts-pro-notices.php file into your plugin folder.

2. Include the file once when on the admin page. This can be done with is_admin() function. 

3. You need to pass the 3 parameters to the default constructor of the ts_pro_notices class. You need to change the value of the variable as per the respective plugin.

    $wcap_plugin_prefix      = 'wcap';
    $wcap_plugin_name        = 'Abandoned Cart Pro for WooCommerce';
    $wcap_lite_plugin_prefix = 'wcal';

    new ts_pro_notices( $wcap_plugin_name, $wcap_lite_plugin_prefix, $wcap_plugin_prefix );

4. Then in the main file you need to update text for the notices. Also, you need to check if any condition needed with any specific plguin.
