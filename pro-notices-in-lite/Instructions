Add some notices of Pro plugins in the lite plugins. 

To add this feature to the plugin, you can follow the below steps:

1. Copy the ts-pro-notices.php file into your plugin folder.
2. Rename the class name with the plugin prefix.

3. Include the file once when on the admin page. This can be done with is_admin() function.

4. You need to pass the 6 parameters to the default constructor of the ts_pro_notices class.
Here, I have taken the example of the Abdnoend cart lite plugin. 
You need to change the value of the variable as per the respective plugin.

    
    $wcal_plugin_name          = 'Abandoned Cart Lite for WooCommerce';
    $wcal_plugin_prefix        = 'wcal';
    $wcal_lite_plugin_prefix   = 'wcal';
    $wcal_file_name            = 'woocommerce-abandoned-cart/woocommerce-ac.php';
    $wcal_pro_file_name        = 'woocommerce-abandon-cart-pro/woocommerce-ac.php';
    $ts_pro_notices = self::wcal_get_notice_text ();
    new Wcal_ts_pro_notices( $wcal_plugin_name, $wcal_lite_plugin_prefix, $wcal_plugin_prefix, $ts_pro_notices, $wcal_file_name, $wcal_pro_file_name );

5. Here, "wcal_get_notice_text()" function will have all the notices text. You can change the notice text from this function only.
