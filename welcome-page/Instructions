Welcome page feature allows you to add an introduction page when a plugin is installed and active for the first time or when it is updated. 

To add this feature to the plugin, you can follow the below steps:

1. Copy the ts-welcome.php file into your plugin folder. 

2. Copy the files in the template folder to template in the plugin.

3. Include the file once when on the admin page. This can be done with is_admin() function. 

4. Change the value of the $plugin_name, $plugin_prefix, $plugin_context, $plugin_folder variables of the TS_Welcome class with the values of your plugin.

5. Change the plugin folder name and main file in the ts_get_version and ts_get_plugin_url function.

6. Once done. You can replace the content of the template files as per your plugin requirements. Add the necessary images and files in your plugin folder as per the description. 

7. Add the below code in the uninstall.php file of the plugin.

delete_option( 'orddd_pro_welcome_page_shown' );
delete_option( 'orddd_pro_welcome_page_shown_time' );

Here 'orddd' will be replaced with the unique prefix of the plugin.
